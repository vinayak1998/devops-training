systemctl status jenkins
# check whether jenkins installed or not
OR
sudo service jenkins status

#jenkins got written in java, it must be running on some port number hence.

cat /etc/sysconfig/jenkins in case of centOS
or /etc/default/jenkins in case of ubuntu
# if permission denied -> enter sudo

JENKINS_PORT = "8080"
(we got it from above)

what is ip of my machine?:
 hostname -I

https:// <ip of my machine> : 8080
 -> jenkins welcome/login page
 -> login jenkins credentials
 -> wait for server reply
 -> jenkins dashboard appears

sudo cat /etc/default/jenkins and check for the port number in the output
HTTP_PORT = "8081"
My port, -> 8081
so from machine browser, go to 
http://localhost:8081
to access the jenkins dashboard

git --version
-> git version 2.17.1
